# Elliptic-Torus

### **What is an Elliptic Torus?**  
An **Elliptic Torus** is a variation of a torus (a donut-shaped surface) where the shape is influenced by an elliptical function rather than a simple circular cross-section. Unlike a standard torus that has a uniform circular profile, an elliptic torus has a more complex, **twisted, and deformed structure**, as seen in the image you shared.

### **Understanding the Equation Used in the Code**  

The parametric equations for the elliptic torus used in the code are:

where:  
- \( u \) and \( v \) are parameters that range from ‚àíùúã to ùúã, defining the **circular sweep** of the torus.
- \( c \) is a constant (here, \( c = 0.3 \)) that controls the **major radius** of the torus.
- \( x, y, z \) define the 3D coordinates of each point on the torus.

---

### **Breaking Down Each Equation**
#### **1. \( x = (c + cos(v)) cos(u) \)**
- The **\( (c + cos(v)) \)** term modifies the **radius** dynamically based on \( v \).
- The **\( cos(u) \)** term determines the positioning along the **x-axis**.

#### **2. \( y = (c + cos(v)) sin(u) \)**
- This is similar to the \( x \)-equation but uses **\( sin(u) \)** for positioning along the **y-axis**.

#### **3. \( z = sin(v) + cos(v) \)**
- Unlike a standard torus where the **\( z \)-coordinate** remains at a fixed height for each cross-section, here, it is influenced by both **\( sin(v) \) and \( cos(v) \)**.
- This creates a **twisted, elliptic effect**, making it look different from a normal torus.

---

### **How This Forms an Elliptic Torus**
- Instead of the usual **circular profile** of a torus, **\( z = sin(v) + cos(v) \)** introduces **non-uniform warping**, making the torus appear **stretched and deformed**.
- The **\( cos(v) \) term** in \( x \) and \( y \) means the **radius is dynamically changing**, rather than being fixed.
- Together, these make the shape resemble a **twisted hourglass-like torus**.

---

### **Footnote**
This elliptic torus is a more complex and aesthetically pleasing variation of a normal torus, with **non-uniform curvature** and a **dynamic radius**, giving it a **unique geometric structure**. The color mapping in your visualization enhances this by highlighting different regions of the torus with a **rainbow gradient**.
